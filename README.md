A Questionnaire and Information site on the Greek Gods 
>>>>>>> 60ff53198e7f9a40d02049164073fcf267e306ec


I Decided to make my project based around the Ancient Greek gods of Olymus.
I started with a questionnaire which then stored the answers and outputted them in a results 
I then had an information page describing each of the greek gods using an image for each and a button link to unhide their description.
After spending several hours i was unable to output images after the third one but could output more images on the same line.
I was unable to get the cordova plugin vibartion to work also.
